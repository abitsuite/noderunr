# Roadmap

An ambitious roadmap is planned during the AVAX retro9000 event.

## 1-Click Blockchain Setup & Installation

Enable the complete download and installation of avalanchego on a local or remote server.

## E2E Encryption (by default)

Allow both guests and members the ability to end-to-end encrypt the communications between the node and their client.

## Windows Support

Will provide node support for Windows 10+, enabling builders to run full node setups on their local workstations.

## Precompiles Concierge

Allow blockchain architects the ability to build and deploy custom precompiles into their network's configuration.
